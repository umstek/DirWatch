# DirWatch
Simple program to monitor file changes in real-time.  

DirWatch extensively uses .NET's built-in [FileSystemWatcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher?view=netframework-4.7). It enables seamless watching of many directories at different locations, including subdirectories or not.
